Installing jqGrid 3.6.2
-----------------------

jqGrid had a very interesting system for downloading and
installing. You had to "build" the .js file on their website by
selecting (by checking checkboxes) various features that you wanted in
your plugin. In this demo I checked all the functionality. This
resulted in a file about 200k large (even when minimised) so we may
very well want to be selective.

% cp css/ui.jqgrid.css path/to/app/public/stylesheets

% cp js/jquery-1.3.2.min       /path/to/app/public/javascripts
% cp js/i18n/grid.locale-en.js /path/to/app/public/javascripts
% cp js/jquery.jqGrid.min      /path/to/app/public/javascripts

Layout file: app/views/layouts/products.html.erb
