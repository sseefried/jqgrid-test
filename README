Introduction
============
Turns out there was a plug-in for this already:

% ./script/plugin install git://github.com/ahe/2dc_jqgrid.git


Testing
=======

To test this application

% rake db:initialise

This will blow away the old database and create a new one filled with some products. Now type:

% script/server 

and navigate to http://localhost:3000

You will get a table that is sortable, editable and that you can add and delete products from.

Source files and URLs to examine
=======================


app/view/layouts/products.html.erb
app/view/products/index.html.erb
app/controllers/products_controller.rb

It's also worth having a look at the plug-in itself in:

vendor/plugins/2dc_jqgrid/lib/2dc_jqgrid.rb

Last of all, check out the tutorial on the plug-in at:

Issues
======
- The delete dialogue stays up after you have deleted products. This
  might 
- Inline editing is cool but only seems to work for strings and
  numbers.  What about validation? What about check boxes and other
  editing controls?


Future work
===========

This plugin is great but it still requires a little too much work in
the controllers. For instance, consider the post_data method in
app/controllers/products_controller.rb. There's a bit too much domain
specific stuff in there. Consider lines like:

19     if params[:oper] == "del"
25     if params[:id] == "_empty"

The plugin should probably provide some methods to automatically add
such methods to the controller dynamically.
